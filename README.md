# Skedulo Frontend Tech Test

Hi! 👋🏻 Welcome to the Skedulo frontend tech test. Start by installing the project and then review the [test instructions](./src/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

This test should take no more than one hour, and is designed to be completed either as an **in-person** pairing exercise or as a **take-home** assignment, depending on your preference.

If you opt to do a take-home assignment, we would love to see a readme that contains some of your thinking while working through the test, constraints you worked within, some decisions and compromises you needed to make, and anything else you think would be interesting for the reviewers to know.

Once you have completed the exercise, reach out to your hiring manager and they will share some github names to add as collaborators who will review your submission.

Good luck! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact your hiring manager.
